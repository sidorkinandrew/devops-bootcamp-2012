## Exercises for Module "Build Tools and Package Manager"

Use any simple Java Gradle application, for example
https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/gradle-sample-app

Your team wants to build out a small helper library in Java and ask you to take over the project.

#### EXERCISE 0: Clone project and create own Git repository

To work with the project for the exercises:

    Clone the project and
    create your own project/git repository from it

#### EXERCISE 1: Run tests, clean and build jar artifact

You want to deploy the artifact to share that library with all team members. So:

    Run gradle test to execute only the tests and check the fix.
    Clean the build folder and try to build jar file again.


#### EXERCISE 2: Start application

Start the jar file to test that the application runs successfully as a jar file

    Start app with java -jar app-1.0.jar

NOTE: replace “app-1.0.jar” with the name of YOUR jar file.
