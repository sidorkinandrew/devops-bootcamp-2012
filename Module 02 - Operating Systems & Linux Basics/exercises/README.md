## Exercises for Module "Linux"

#### EXERCISE 1: Bash Script - Install Java

Write a bash script using Vim editor that installs the latest java version and checks whether java was installed successfully by executing a java -version command. Checks if it was successful and prints a success message, if not prints a failure message.

#### EXERCISE 2: Bash Script - User Processes

Write a bash script using Vim editor that checks all the processes running for the current user (USER env var) and prints out the processes in console. Hint: use ps aux command and grep for the user.

#### EXERCISE 3: Bash Script - User Processes Sorted

Extend the previous script to ask for a user input for sorting the processes output either by memory or CPU consumption, and print the sorted list.

#### EXERCISE 4: Bash Script - Number of User Processes Sorted

Extend the previous script to ask additionally for user input about how many processes to print. Hint: use head program to limit the number of outputs.

Context: We have a ready NodeJS application that needs to run on a server. The app is already configured to read in environment variables.

#### EXERCISE 5: Bash Script - Start Node App

Write a bash script with following logic:

    Install NodeJS and NPM and print out which versions were installed
    Download an artifact file from the URL: https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz 9. Hint: use curl or wget
    Unzip the downloaded file
    Set the following needed environment variables: APP_ENV=dev, DB_USER=myuser, DB_PWD=mysecret
    Change into the unzipped package directory
    Run the NodeJS application by executing the following commands: npm install and node server.js

Notes:

    Make sure to run the application in background so that it doesn’t block the terminal session where you execute the shell script
    If any of the variables is not set, the node app will print error message that env vars is not set and exit
    It will give you a warning about LOG_DIR variable not set. You can ignore it for now.

#### EXERCISE 6: Bash Script - Node App Check Status

Extend the script to check after running the application that the application has successfully started and prints out the application’s running process and the port where it’s listening.

#### EXERCISE 7: Bash Script - Node App with Log Directory

Extend the script to accept a parameter input log_directory: a directory where application will write logs.

The script will check whether the parameter value is a directory name that doesn’t exist and will create the directory, if it does exist, it sets the env var LOG_DIR to the directory’s absolute path before running the application, so the application can read the LOG_DIR environment variable and write its logs there.

Note:

    Check the app.log file in the provided LOG_DIR directory.


#### EXERCISE 8: Bash Script - Node App with Service user

You’ve been running the application with your user. But we need to adjust that and create own service user: myapp for the application to run. So extend the script to create the user and then run the application with the service user.
